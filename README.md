# Vote-it-up

There are many problems that we are facing in our current democracy, major being all the descrepencies in the election. Due to some issues we forget to make our voter id becoming busy in our daily hectic lives. Lack of public awareness, constant threat of rigging, hacking or vote manipulation has always been concern of the masses.

The web app we are designing is to tackle these basic but mind-bugging problems. We add the data of all the current voting eligible participants to generate a special voting id for them using the hash of blockchain. It will further be extended to tackle the problem of generation of new voter id. All the teens turning adult will have automatic generation of their voter id automatically, just by entering their aadhar details adding to the specific ledger of that person. This will enable many more younger citizens to elect their chosen candidates and deciding what future they want to be in. Also this will be linked to the death certificate of a citizen automatically making their voter id invalid after their death preventing wrong voting from rigged candidates.

This will also enable to solve the problem from voting from different cities as they will have their voting id and login from different cities as well. We can surely expect an increased voter turn-out because of this. Blockchain ensures cyber security and helps the people to be secured of their online safety.

We are planning to extend this idea further if possible to check the name missing from voter's list. Having all the data stored in the blockchain regarding the people information will enable to crosscheck with the population list that no person is added or left out.

This will help us a lot as this is decentralised and no central authority is given too much power. The transparency will help us to check whether election is not rigged or people aren't manipulated. Our novel idea aims to help every eligible citizen to vote.
